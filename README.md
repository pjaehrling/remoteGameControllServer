A small node.js server, which recives acceleration data from one client over socket.io and forwards them directly to a second client.
This was a project done for university and is still work in progress. By now there is not a real registration and authentication process.

Current status: The test clients are able to send and recive the acceleration data and move a circle drawn on a canvas on the test reciver.
